OPERATING SYSTEM LAB #3

In this lab I used Ubuntu Linux Operating System and learned to use system calls. 

Lab task #1: Write your university cardâ€™s details in a text file using write system call. Now read the contents
of the file using read system call. 

- In this task I created 3 files:
   - 2.cpp
   - code.c
   - myfile.txt
- Using the folowing comands on ubuntu terminal
  - cat > myfile.txt 
  - gedit code.c 
  - gedit 2.cpp 


 - I solved the task and wrote its solution in .cpp and .c file (myfile.txt file is empty and output is written in it once i enter terminal commands)
